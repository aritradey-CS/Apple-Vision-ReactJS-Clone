            Our most advanced <br />
            Spatial Audio system ever.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Dual-driver audio pods positioned next to each ear deliver
            personalized sound while letting you hear what’s around you.
            <span class="highlight-page20">Spatial Audio</span> makes sounds
            feel like they’re coming from your surroundings. Audio ray tracing
            analyzes your room’s acoustic properties to adapt and match sound to
            your space. And if you want to use headphones with Apple Vision Pro,
            the new AirPods Pro (2nd generation) offer the perfect experience,
            featuring Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency enabled by the H2
            chip in both devices.
